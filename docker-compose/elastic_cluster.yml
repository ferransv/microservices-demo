#  three nodes for the elasticsearch as was in the kafka cluster.
#  We have this number again to accomplish quorum and to prevent split brain issue, while maximizing number of nodes which could be down.
#  It is advice to use odd numbers of master eligible nodes.
#  As with 3 nodes for example, you can have at most one node down to construct a network with a quorum of two nodes.
#  Elastic quorum Formula: (master_elegible_nodes / 2) + 1 -> in our example quorum = 3/2 + 1 = 2
#  (for example with a cluster of 3 nodes -> maste e nodes = 2; so if one is down you cannot maintain a cluster
# That's why we need at least three nodes to maintain a cluster in case one node is not running while also accomplishing quorum.

#A node is a single server that is a part of a cluster. A node stores data and participates in the cluster’s indexing and search capabilities.
#  Master Node — Controls the Elasticsearch cluster and is responsible for all cluster-wide operations like creating/deleting an index and adding/removing nodes.
#  Data Node — Stores data and executes data-related operations such as search and aggregation.
#  Client Node — Forwards cluster requests to the master node and data-related requests to data nodes.
