#The bootstrap yaml files are loaded, like thie one, by a parent spring application context, so it will be loaded before
#application yaml file. And for the spring cloud, we need to set bootstrap phase configurations in this
#  file, **because this bootstrap yaml file will be used to obtain the application configuration from the
#  config server repository** prior to loading application yaml file.

#  This file tells the Spring Cloud Config service what port to listen in on, the
#  application name, the application profiles, and the location where we will store the
#  configuration data.
